This is my first web development project for ICUIWD.
I used HTML to create a basic website with a heading, paragraph, and examples from topics 
like:
-Example of an HTML Editor is Atom or VS Code
-An Example of HTML colours is RGB standing for Red Green and Blue 255,00,00 would be the coulor Red
-Example of an HTML Paragraph element p in angle brackets < >
I created this using Visual Studio Code and will push it to GitHub.
